ENCAPSULATION

Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques. The class will be called Printer and it will simulate a real Computer Printer. It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed, and also whether itâ€™s a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed.


INHERITANCE

Start with a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from thisbase class. Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car (Say Honda City) that inherits from the Car class. You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.For specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car
